            <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            It’s a single serving brownie made with fewer ingredients, mixed together & microwaved right in a mug in about a
            minute.
            It’s fast, sweet, chocolatey, and everything you could want from a brownie

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a medium microwavable mug (roughly 1 cup measurement) mix together the flour, cocoa powder, brown sugar, and salt.</li>
                <li>In to the dry ingredients add in the milk, oil, and vanilla extract and mix together until you form your batter.</li>
                <li>Mix in the chocolate chips. (If you don’t want to cook them off straight away, then place them in the refrigerator for
                up to 24 hours.)</li>
                <li>Microwave for 1 minute 40 seconds - 1 minute 50 seconds or until it has risen and the batter doesn't look wet. (Timing
                is based on my 1200W microwave so your timing might vary).</li>
                <li>Serve warm with vanilla ice cream & enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
